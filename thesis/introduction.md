## Product Placement in Media
---

* OPENING CONTEXT: Advertising is an expected part of consuming media nowadays ranging from commercials to celebrity endorsements. 

  PROBLEM: However, product placement blurs the line between content and marketing by embedding brands and products in the very material viewers may not think of as advertising.

  RESPONSE: This is especially problematic in music videos where disclosure is not required and what follows is an analysis of gratuitous examples.

## Diversity in Film
---

* OPENING CONTEXT: It's common to see a Westernized perspective of the world in Hollywood, from individual roles of people to the stories told.

  PROBLEM: In doing so, the film industry lends itself to tropes not just by subverting inclusion in diversity, but by reinforcing stereotypes and clich√©s of characters.

  RESPONSE: It isn't just an issue of including more of certain races and ethnicities but an issue of putting forth more meaningful and high quality representations for a perspective that better reflects people at large.
